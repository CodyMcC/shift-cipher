# Kim's shift-cipher project

# Level 1
Create a program that will:
1. Take lower case text from a user
2. Apply a cassar chipher (shift 3)
3. Print the encoded text

## Rules: 
1. Do not import anything

## Notes:
1. Ciphertext == Encrypted text
2. Cleartext == Not encrypted text 
3. You will need to use the built in chr() and ord() functions
4. Save each version of your program at each level as a seperate file so you have a clear veiw of your progress. 

# Level 2 

Add the functionality:

1. Accept user input that contains text encrypted with the caesar cipher (shift 3)
2. Decode the text
3. Print the decoded text back to the user

## Rules: 
1. Do not import anything

## Notes:
1. This program will need to let the user enter both cleartext or ciphertext 

# Level 3

## Rules:
1. Do not import anything
