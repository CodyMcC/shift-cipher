# Kim's shift-cipher project

It's understandable that you will use google for this project. Your goal should be to google the smallest piece necessary and not find full examples of a shift cipher to copy. The more you think through how to solve the tasks on your own and just use google for things like understanding the syntax, the more you will gain from this project. 

# Level 1
## Goals 
1. Take lower case text from a user
2. Apply a caesar chipher (shift 3)
3. Print the encoded text

## Rules: 
1. Do not import anything

## Notes:
1. Ciphertext == Encrypted text
2. Cleartext == Non-encrypted text 
3. Learn about the ASCII table
4. Learn about the basic Caesar cipher
4. You will need to use the built in chr() and ord() functions
5. Save each version of your program at each level as a seperate file so you have a clear veiw of your progress. 

# Level 2 

## Goals

1. Accept user input that contains text encrypted with the caesar cipher (shift 3)
2. Decode the text
3. Print the decoded text back to the user

## Rules: 
1. Do not import anything

## Notes:
1. This program will need to let the user choose to enter cleartext or ciphertext 

# Level 3

## Goals
1. Accept uppercase and lowercase cleartext and ciphertext
2. The output will always be uppercase (abc -> DEF)
3. Ignore punctuation (A!B?C -> DEF)
4. Pass numbers through unchanged  (ABC123 -> DEF123)

## Rules:
1. Do not import anything

# Level 4

## Goals
1. 

## Rules:
